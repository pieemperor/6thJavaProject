# 6th Java Project

Project 6 is a mock reservation system.  It will ask the user which room they want to stay in and it will 
calculate their total bill as well as store the user’s contact information.  In this project, I learned about 
overriding Java’s default functions with more useful ones.  I also made use of different Class constructors.

This project was done for my 1st Intro to Computer Science class
